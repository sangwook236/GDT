[-] Installation (Ubuntu).
	- Install.
		apt install libvtk6-dev
		apt install libvtk6-qt-dev
		apt install libvtk7-dev
		apt install libvtk7-qt-dev
			VTK versions are too low.
		apt install vtkdata

[-] Installation (Python).
	- Install.
		conda install vtk
		pip install vtk

[-] Building (MSVC6).
	- Download VTK.
		Related files:
			VTK source code and examples.
			Data file for VTK.
		http://www.vtk.org
	- Download CMake.
		http://www.cmake.org/
	- Uncompress.

	- mkdir build.
	- Run CMake.
	- Set options.
		Set VTK_DATA_ROOT.
			e.g.) ${VTK_HOME}/VTKData-release-4-2
		To use the STLport, add "/D VTK_USE_ANSI_STDLIB" to the compile option.
			CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
			CMAKE_C_FLAGS
	- Generate build files.

	- Open "${VTK_BUILD_ROOT}/CMake/VTK_LOADED_COMMANDS.dsw" in Visual Studio IDE.
	- Build.
		Build the "ALL_BUILD" project.
		Build the "RUN_TESTS" project.
		Build the "INSTALL" project.
			Files are generated in ${VTK_BUILD_ROOT}:
				Drive:/usr/local/include/vtk
				Drive:/usr/local/lib/vtk
				Drive:/usr/local/lib/vtk/CMake
		==> Because generated files have the same file names for debug & release builds, be careful not to overwrite them during installation.
			It is sometimes necessary to move DLL files generated in the release or debug directory to the "${VTK_BUILD_ROOT}/CMake" directory.
